/**
 * There are four substring missions that were born all in one day
 * and you shouldnâ€™t be needed more than one day to solve them.
 * All of those mission can be simply solved by brute force,
 * but is it always the best way to go?
 * (you might not have access to all of those missions yet,
 * but they are going to be available with more opened islands on the map).
 * 
 * This mission is the first one of the series.
 * Here you should find the length of the longest substring that consists of the same letter.
 * For example, line "aaabbcaaaa" contains four substrings
 * with the same letters "aaa", "bb","c" and "aaaa".
 * 
 * The last substring is the longest one which makes it an answer.
 * 
 * Input: String.
 * Output: Int.
 * 
 * Example:
 * longRepeat('sdsffffse') == 4
 * longRepeat('ddvvrwwwrggg') == 3
